PROJECT:- OWN PRINTF FUNCTION _printf(). REPOSITORY:- printf. CONTRIBUTORS:- Maurice Haro and Wisdom Dzontoh.


_printf is a function that does formatted printing. In this project we develop this function for simple printing and the specifications for formatted printing.

Depending on yhe content in the parameter list (), the function will use simple printing or use the specifiers for formatted printing.

In this project, we concentrate on Task 0, Task 1 and Task 2 which are mandatory. The advanced tasks will be tackled with time
